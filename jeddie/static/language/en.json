  "our_story_detail": "<p>Jen and Eddie began their courtship in keeping with the most sacred of millennial traditions: by swiping right on Bumble. After a short conversation, and motivated by their mutual need for a Brewery Passport stamp, they decided to go out for a first date at Bookhouse Brewery in Hingetown. Satisfied with their initial meeting, Jen offered two suggestions for a second date: the Greek Festival or the Garlic Festival. An obvious choice led them to share a delicious basket of garlic fries and a detestable cup of garlic ice cream, solidifying the start of a promising relationship and proving definitively that Eddie is not a vampire.</p><p>During three years together, Jen and Eddie supported each other through COVID, learned to live together under a single roof, saw many musicals together, and traveled to places like Spain, Miami, and the Southwest U.S. On May 27, 2022, under a tree in Central Park, and in front of many curious squirrels, Eddie proposed, and Jen said yes. The rest is history.</p>",
